"""Resolves which accounts a user can reach, and how to reach them.

Google Ads access is granted either directly on an account or on a manager
account (MCC), in which case it cascades to every account beneath it. To query
a child account through a manager grant, the API requires a `login-customer-id`
header naming a manager in that child's hierarchy.

This module derives both facts per user, live from the Google Ads hierarchy:

1. `ListAccessibleCustomers` returns the accounts the user is a *direct* member
   of -- under a nested-MCC structure these are the sub-MCCs they were granted.
2. A `customer_client` query rooted at each of those expands it to every
   descendant account, which is what the user actually works on.

Google Ads therefore remains the single source of truth for access; nothing
here is configured server-side.
